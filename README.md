## Hill Climbing Genetic Algorithm

**Background:** Hill climber may be used to find solutions to a wide variety of problems. Each 
hill climbing individual  increases its fitness through trial and error e.g., 
 
1. Create a random individual 
2. Change (mutate) the individual  
3. Measure fitness. If it is worse then keep original  
4. Go to 1

We will implement a population of such hill climber all evolving independently. The problem is 
as follows: 

The knapsack (KP) problem is an example 
of a combinatorial optimization problem. It is 
concerned with a knapsack that has positive 
integer volume (or capacity) **V**. There are **n** 
distinct items that may potentially be placed 
in the knapsack. Item **i** has a positive integer 
volume **Vi** and positive integer benefit **Bi**. In 
the most basic form of the problem we will 
consider there are only one of each item 
available (0-1 KP).

### Explanation
For example suppose we have a knapsack that has a capacity of 20 cubic inches and N=10 
items of different sizes and different benefits. We want to include in the knapsack only these 
items that will have the greatest total benefit within the constraint of the knapsackâ€™s capacity. As seen in the table below:
